# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shreyash! 🚀  

I navigate the world of **product, strategy, and AI automation**—blending business thinking with a growing love for code.  
Think of me as a product guy who **actually** tries to understand what’s going on under the hood. 😆👨‍💻

## 🛠 What I’m Building  
I believe in **learning by doing**, so here are some of my **side projects & experiments**:  

🤖 **Personal AI Agent** → Because having my own AI assistant to keep me productive sounds way cooler than a to-do list.   
📅 **Calendar Buddy** → Uses **RAG & Google Calendar API** to turn messy text into structured events. Who needs manual scheduling anymore? 📅🚀  
🔜 **More experiments coming soon!** 👀  

📌 **Check them out on my GitHub!** 👇

## 💡 Things I’m Learning  
🦾 **Agentic Workflows** – Why should humans do all the work? 😉  
🧠 **AI & LLMs** – Figuring out how to make machines *think* (or at least fake it convincingly). 🤖💬  
⚡ **Python & APIs** – Because **automation > manual effort**.   
👨‍💻 **Better GitHub Hygiene** – Still working on not breaking my repos. 😅
